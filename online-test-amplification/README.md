# Learn Online Testing Amplification
This repository contains all courseware to master test amplification technology.

Here you'll learn how to exploit the behaviour of your code to generate more test cases.

You'll find how to speed up the investigation phase on your bugs raised during operations, with **[Botsing](https://github.com/STAMP-project/botsing)**, a technology able to automatically generate a test case able to reproduce the same error you discovered in production logs. In this way it will be easier for you to find the right bugfix.

Moreover, you will learn how to use behavioural models, to understand better how your code actually works, and then to identify possible areas of improvement.

## Reproduce crashes with Botsing
**[Botsing](https://github.com/STAMP-project/botsing)** does the magic to generate automatically test cases (real Java code!) taking as input a (log containing a) stacktrace coming from your production or test environments. When a developer faces a new bug, the first thing he tries to achieve is to reproduce the bug itself. Often this is a time consuming and frustrating activity (also because more than often end users don't provide enough information).

### Botsing Demo
Curious to see how it works? Please follow the **["Botsing demo" tutorial](https://github.com/STAMP-project/botsing-demo)**.

### Botsing for Maven projects
Curious to see how it works? Please check the **["Botsing Maven plugin" official page](https://github.com/STAMP-project/botsing/tree/master/botsing-maven)**.


### Botsing IDE
Do you prefer to leverage Botsing capabilities within your preferred IDE? No problem! You can install the [STAMP IDE](https://github.com/STAMP-project/stamp-ide) in your Eclipse instance. Please follow this **[guide](https://github.com/STAMP-project/stamp-ide/blob/master/README_Botsing.md)**.

## Generate tests with behavioral models
Behavioral models represent usage of different objects involved in the source code. Feeding **[Evosuite](http://www.evosuite.org/)** with this model provide us with automatically generated test cases.
The behavioral model is generated by a Botsing component, named **[Botsing Model Generation](https://github.com/STAMP-project/botsing/tree/master/botsing-model-generation)**.
