# Learn Software Testing AMPlification
This repository contains all courseware to master test amplification technology.

From here you can start to learn principles (the three pillars) of software testing amplification, as well as exploiting them in your DevOps processes:

1. **[Test Amplification](unit-test-amplification/README.md)**:  learn how to exploit STAMP testing amplification capabilities;
1. **[Test Configuration Amplification](conf-test-amplification/README.md)**: learn how to exploit STAMP test configuration amplification capabilities
1. **[Runtime Testing Amplification](runtime-amplification/README.md)**: learn how to exploit STAMP runtime amplification capabilities;
1. **[STAMP in DevOps](devops/README.md)**: learn how to exploit STAMP technology in your DevOps processes.


Don't know what is DevOps and why should it matter? Stay tuned, we'll provide you with some information about it.
